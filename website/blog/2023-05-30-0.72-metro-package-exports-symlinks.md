Today we’re releasing 0.72!

This release adds a couple of highly requested features for Metro and developer experience improvements. So much of this work stems from your feedback on the [2022 community survey](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/528) -- thank you to all those that participated!

## Highlights

### Metro

#### Symlink support (Beta)

Symlink support continues to be one of the top-requested features in Metro and for React Native 0.72, Metro introduces pre-stable support for resolving symlinks.

Symlink support enables React Native to work transparently with monorepo setups and pnpm, removing the need for workarounds. See [Enabling pre-stable features](/blog/2023/05/30/0.72-metro-package-exports-symlinks#enabling-pre-stable-features) to use in your app.

#### Package Exports support (Beta)

[Package Exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) is the modern alternative to the package.json "main" field and provides new capabilities for npm packages to define their public API and target React Native.

By enabling Package Exports support in your Metro config, your app will be compatible with the wider JavaScript ecosystem, including via the new "react-native" community condition. See [Enabling pre-stable features](/blog/2023/05/30/0.72-metro-package-exports-symlinks#enabling-pre-stable-features) to use in your app.

#### New Metro config file setup

In React Native 0.72, we’ve changed the config loading setup for Metro in React Native CLI. Please update your project’s `metro.config.js` file to match the [template’s version](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/76a42c292de838a0dd537935db792eaa81410b9b/packages/react-native/template/metro.config.js).

:::info
Please update your config file to following [format](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/76a42c292de838a0dd537935db792eaa81410b9b/packages/react-native/template/metro.config.js). Changes to `metro.config.js` will become required in 0.73. For 0.72, we will log a warning if not updated.
:::

This moves control over extending the base React Native Metro config into your project, and we’ve cleaned up the leftover defaults. In addition, this means that standalone Metro CLI commands, such as `metro get-dependencies`, will now work.

#### Enabling pre-stable features

To enable these new Metro features in your project, update your app’s `metro.config.js` file and set either the `resolver.unstable_enableSymlinks` or `resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports` options.

```js
const config = {
  // ...
  resolver: {
    unstable_enableSymlinks: true,
    unstable_enablePackageExports: true,
  },
};
```

### Developer Experience Improvements

#### No more redboxes with invalid style properties

Prior to this release, providing an invalid style property in StyleSheet would result in a redbox. This is a high signal error that disrupts the developer workflow for a relatively low-risk error.

In 0.72, we’ve relaxed this expectation to fail silently, like providing an invalid CSS property in the browser.

#### Better error readability

Hermes has added better error message when invoking an undefined callable.

```
    var x = undefined; x();
    // Before: undefined is not a function
    // After: x is not a function (it is undefined)
```

As well, LogBox stack traces now filter out internal Hermes bytecode frames that are not relevant to app users. [4c911a2dec](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/4c911a2deceb59fc07735205ae3a4622b4334f88)

#### Improved error output of the React Native CLI

0.72 ships with React Native CLI v11.2.2 which includes improvements to reduce duplication, clarify wording, reduce verbose stack traces, and add deep links to relevant docs in the following commands `init` , `run-android` and `run-ios`.

You can find other improvements in the [React Native CLI changelogs](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/releases/tag/v11.2.2).

#### Faster compilation and JSON parsing in Hermes

Hermes has improved the compilation time of large object literals. For example, in one reported issue, [#852](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/852), a user had an entire dataset written out as a large object literal. By improving the de-duplication algorithm Hermes uses, compilation sped up by 97% ([221c](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/221ce21a209e2e32a3eaaa2d9e28ca81842fad20)). These improvements will benefit build times for apps that bundle many objects.

Optimizations ([de9c](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/de9cff2aa41fc1f297b568848143347823d73659), [6e2d](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/6e2dd652c8d90c5d59737a81f66a259efffdcd00)) to JSON parsing have also landed, benefiting apps using libraries like redux-persist that rely heavily on JSON manipulation.

#### More ECMAScript support in Hermes

Support for the following specifications in Hermes.

- prototype.at support for [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/at), [TypedArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray/at) and [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/at). See [#823](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/823) ([ebe2](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/ebe2915ac386a6b73dec39c2af4ac7063e68cd99)).
- Implement [well-formed JSON.stringify](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-well-formed-stringify) ([d41d](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/d41decf244aa814b1e58827a9de982f3b71667de)) to prevent ill-formed Unicode strings
- Implement [AggregateError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AggregateError) ([9b25](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/9b25a2530eb515f6c4fbd397ae290b6c97c049b2)) that represents several errors wrapped in a single error. Useful for multiple errors like from [`Promise.any()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any) when all promises passed to it reject.

For users on JSC, these features are already available.

### Mitigation for TextInput ANRs on Android

Earlier this year our team was alerted of frequent and persistent ANRs (application not reponsive) around multi-line TextInputs from a high volume of community reports. Investigating, we isolated the issue to devices using the Samsung soft keyboard with Grammarly enabled ([issue/35936](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/35936)).

Our best understanding is a correlation of using and re-formatting a large number of `AbsoluteSizeSpan`s. We were able to reproduce the issue outside of React Native, on a template Android application and found this issue also impacts the larger Android app ecosystem.

We have reached out to Samsung to share our findings and hope it will be addressed by Samsung in a future update.

As a mitigation for the React Native community, we have landed a change to reduce our dependency on `AbsoluteSizeSpans` in cases where they can be omitted. This is not a complete solution but lowers number of cases this ANR may occur.

This mitigation is in 0.72 and has been back-ported to the following versions:

- [0.71.7](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.71.7)
- [0.70.9](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.70.9)
- [0.69.10](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.69.10)
- [0.68.7](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.68.7)

### Moving New Architecture Updates to the Working Group

At this stage, New Architecture updates are most relevant to early adopters of the New Architecture.

To keep updates clear and focussed on the target audience, we are moving 0.72, and future New Architecture updates to the dedicated working group. This change will also allow us to share more frequent updates, such as work that ships in our nightlies.

## Breaking Changes

### Deprecated Component Removals

We’ve removed the following packages from React Native in 0.72 and you can use the recommended community package.

- [Slider](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/slider), [@react-native-community/slider](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-slider/tree/main/package)
- [DatePickerIOS](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/datepickerios), [@react-native-community/datetimepicker](https://github.com/react-native-datetimepicker/datetimepicker)
- [ProgressViewIOS](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/progressviewios), [@react-native-community/progress-view](https://github.com/react-native-progress-view/progress-view)

### Package Renames

All packages published from the repository now live under `react-native/packages`, and are published under the [@react-native npm scope](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40react-native) to ensure clear ownership.

There are no changes to the [react-native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native) package.

Here are all the packages renamed:

- `@react-native-community/eslint-config` to `@react-native/eslint-config`
- `@react-native-community/eslint-plugin` to `@react-native/eslint-plugin`
- `@react-native/polyfills` to `@react-native/js-polyfills`
- `@react-native/normalize-color` to `@react-native/normalize-colors`
- `@react-native/assets` to `@react-native/assets-registry`
- `react-native-codegen` to `@react-native/codegen`
- `react-native-gradle-plugin` to `@react-native/gradle-plugin`

This change will not affect you if you have no direct dependency on a renamed package. Otherwise, when upgrading to React Native 0.72, update any renamed dependency to its ~0.72 version.

## Acknowledgements

A lot of this release came from the direct feedback from the community. From reports on [noisy redboxes](https://twitter.com/baconbrix/status/1623039650775371792), [bugs with Package Exports](https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/965), [benchmarks for the New Architecture](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/85) — all of it is valuable to hear and we appreciate the time it takes to share.

Thank you!
